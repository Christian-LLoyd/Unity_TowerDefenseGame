# Eco Defender 🌱🛡️

Eco Defender is a top-down roguelike defense game built in Unity 3D, where players take on the role of a Kapre, a guardian spirit from Philippine mythology, to protect the ecosystem from destruction.

🌍 Story & Theme

In a world teetering on the brink of ecological collapse, deforestation, polluted waters, and toxic air threaten the last remaining sanctuary of life, the Sacred Tree. From deep within the forest, a forgotten guardian awakens.

You are the Kapre, a mythical protector of the land, summoned once more to defend nature’s final stronghold. As waves of destruction close in, your ancient powers must rise to meet them. Channel the strength of the earth, the wind, and the spirit of the forest to repel the forces of ruin.

This is not just a battle, it’s a stand against extinction.

Will you protect the Sacred Tree, or witness the fall of the last green hope?
